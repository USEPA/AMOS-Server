The following is a list of the tables found in the PostgreSQL database that this Flask app calls, along with descriptions of the tables' columns' contents.


SUBSTANCES
This table stores information about the substances that are searchable in this database.  The information is pulled from DSSTox.
- dtxsid: Substance ID used by EPA's DSSTox product.
- dtxcid: Compound ID used by DSSTox.  Not guaranteed to exist for this data.
- casrn: Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number.
- jchem_inchikey: JChem InChIKey corresponding to the substance.
- indigo_inchikey: Indigo InChIKey corresponding to the substance.  Does not exist for all substances, unlike the JChem InChIKey.
- preferred_name: Name of the substance.  These are standardized to the EPA's preferred names as much as possible.
- molecular_formula: Molecular formula of the substance.
- molecular_weight: Weight of the substance, in Daltons.


SYNONYMS
Since there are a lot of possible names for substances, but only one EPA-preferred name, this table covers a list of synonyms and the associated DTXSIDs.
- dtxsid: Substance ID used by EPA's DSSTox product.
- synonym: Synonym for the substance.


CONTENTS
This table connects the substance information tables (via the DTXSID) to the rest of the information for each record (via the internal identifier of the substance).
- dtxsid: Substance ID used by EPA's DSSTox product.
- internal_id: Unique identifier for each record.  For the most part, these identifiers are either the identifiers used in the original sources' data, or identifiers assigned by EPA curators (the latter generally only applies to methods).  This identifier is used across all tables that aren't purely concerned with substance information.


RECORD INFO
This table covers general info that is associated with every kind of record in the database.  Its contents are primarily used by the main search results, though some fields are used to augment results on other pages.
- internal_id: Same as above.
- spectrum_types: A list of the spectrum/methodology types present in the record.
- source: The source where the data was acquired from.  Note that this isn't necessarily the origin of the data, as some sources (e.g., MoNA) aggregate several other sources of data.
- link: The URL where the original record can be found.
- experimental: Boolean indicating whether the record is the result of experimental data (true) or not (false).  At the moment, this is expected to always be true, as the focus of the project is experimental records.
- external_use_allowed: Whether the record will be displayable outside the EPA.  Currently not used by the app.
- description: A description of the data in the record.  The exact contents of this string vary a lot, but generally, this field covers experimental parameters for spectra and summaries or abstracts for fact sheets and methods.
- data_type: Indicates what kind of data this record is associated with.  Current values include "PDF", "Mass Spectrum", and null (for external records not stored in the database).
- record_type: The kind of record that this entry represents -- either a spectrum, a fact sheet, or a method.


MASS SPECTRA
This table stores information specific to mass spectra whose spectra are stored directly in the database (so sources that we can only link to, such as SpectraBase, won't have rows in this table).
- internal_id: Same as above.
- splash: Spectral Hash Identifier.  See https://splash.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/ for more information.
- spectrum: The spectrum, formatted as two-dimensional array describing a list of charge-to-mass ratios and intensities.
- spectral_entropy: A measurement of the quality of a spectrum, calculated using code based on MoNA's source code.  Will be missing values for spectra with one point (while the formula does actually give a valid value for this case -- zero -- it is not useful, and is stored as missing to be consistent with the normalized entropy below).
- normalized_entropy: A measurement of the quality of a spectrum.  It is a scaling of the spectral entropy to try to offset the effects of having a large number of peaks in the data.
- has_associated_method: A boolean indicating whether there is a method associated with this spectrum.
- spectrum_metadata: A JSON document storing information about the spectrum, usually about the instrument and test conditions it was created under.


SPECTRUM PDFS
This table contains information specific to PDFs that contain spectra that are stored in the database, as well as the PDFs themselves.
- internal_id: Same as above.
- pdf_data: The PDF file, stored as binary data.
- pdf_metadata: A JSON document storing information about the PDF.
- sub_source: Some sources include PDFs from other sources.  This field is used to denote that original source.
- date_published: A string containing the publication date of the PDF.  The format of the dates is not guaranteed to be consistent between all document.


FACT SHEETS
This table contains information specific to fact sheets stored in the database, as well as the fact sheet PDFs themselves.
- internal_id: Same as above.
- pdf_data: The PDF file, stored as binary data.
- pdf_metadata: A JSON document storing information about the fact sheet.  Fields in the metadata are not guaranteed to be consistent across all records.
- sub_source: Some of the sources that we pull directly from include fact sheets from other sources.  This field is used to denote that original source.
- date_published: A string containing the publication date of the fact sheet.  The format of the dates is not guaranteed to be consistent between all fact sheets.
- fact_sheet_name: The name/title of the fact sheet.
- document_type: A shorthand for the type of document.  Usually an abbreviation.
- analyte: The analyte being examined in the fact sheet.


METHODS
This table contains information specific to methods stored in the database, as well as the method PDFs themselves.
- internal_id: Same as above.
- pdf_data: The PDF file, stored as binary data.
- pdf_metadata: A JSON document storing metadata about the method.  Fields in the metadata are not guaranteed to be consistent across all records.
- date_published: A string containing the publication date of the method.  The format of the dates is not guaranteed to be consistent between all methods.
- method_name: The name/title of the methods.
- method_number: A secondary identification number for the method.  Values in internal_id are currently generated by
- analyte: Descriptions of the substance(s) that the method is concerned with.  These aren't necessarily the individual substances, but this is more specific than the chemical_class field.
- chemical_class: The category or categories of substances that the analytes belong to.
- matrix: The matrix where the substance was discovered and/or analyzed in.
- has_associated_spectra: A boolean indicating whether there are any spectra associated with this method.

- publisher: Name of the organization that published the method.
- mmdb_matrix: Name of the MMDB category that maps to our curated matrix assignment.


METHODS WITH SPECTRA
This table pairs the internal IDs of methods with the spectra associated with them.  Spectra referenced in this table are assumed to have the spectrum actually in the database (not externally linked or in PDF form).
- method_id: The internal ID of a method.  Should be the internal_id value of a record with record_type="Method".
- spectrum_id: The internal ID of a spectrum.  Should be the internal_id value of a record with record_type="Spectrum".


SUBSTANCE IMAGES
This table stores images of substances which have images of the structure available in DSSTox's database but which are not yet publicly available on the API that CompTox gets its images from.
- dtxsid: The DTXSID of the substance.
- png_image: The image of the substance, as a binary blob.


ANALYTICAL QC
This table stores a collection of spectra-containing PDFs that are from the Analytical QC project.  Since the project itself has a great deal of supporting data unique to it, a special table was warranted.
- internal_id: Same as elsewhere.

- flags: Semicolon-delimited list of flags associated with a record's substance.


DATABASE SUMMARY
This table holds precalculated values regarding the contents of the database for use on the About page.  This table was put together to avoid having to recalculate these values from scratch every time the page is loaded, at the cost of needing to update these values whenever records are added to or removed from the database.  As a result, the contents of this table are a bit more haphazard than in other tables.
- count_type: Part of the description of what's being counted in this row.  Usually either a record type, substance count, or source count.
- subtype: The other part of the description.
- value_count: The count of whatever's being described in the row.


ADDITIONAL SOURCES
This table contains links to other sources on a per-substance basis.  Since AMOS's focus is somewhat specialized, these can allow easy access to other information beyond AMOS's immediate scope.
- dtxsid: The substance the source covers.
- source_name: Name of the source, which is used for the hyperlink's text.
- link: The URL to the additional source.
- description: A field for potential hovertext, if needed.  Currently unused.


NMR SPECTRA
This table holds one-dimensional NMR spectra, along with some associated information.  This table may be subject to change, as work on NMR spectra has not been going on very long.
- internal_id: Same as elsewhere.
- frequency: Frequency of the spectrometer in megahertz.
- nucleus: The nucleus being observed during the experiment.
- solvent: Solvent that the sample is dissolved/suspended in.
- temperature: The ambient temperature during the experiment in Celsius.
- coupling_constants: A JSON structure containing information on the coupling constants.  Currently not defined.
- first_x: Starting value on the horizontal axis.
- last_x: Ending value on the horizontal axis.
- x_units: Units on the horizontal axis.  I believe we're hoping to standardize on ppm, so this may go away in the future.
- intensities: One-dimensional array containing the intensities.  The length of the array is also used to interpolate the values on the horizontal axis.
- spectrum_metadata: JSON structure containing additional data of interest for the spectrum.


CLASSYFIRE
This table contains a copy of ClassyFire, which defines classifications for substances.  Note that the spelling "klass" is used instead of "class" to avoid keyword issues in the programming.
- dtxsid: Same as elsewhere.
- kingdom: Highest-level classification; should only be "organic compounds" or "inorganic compounds".
- superklass: Second-highest level of classification; more refined than kingdoms but more structure-specific.
- klass: Third-highest level of classification; much more structure-specific classifications.
- subklass: Fourth-highest level of classification.
- direct_parent: Category defined by the largest structural feature of the compound.
- geometric_descriptor: Structure-based category for the substance.
- alternative_parents: Additional categories that are valid descriptions of the substance.
- substituents: Structural features in the substance that can be substituted.
